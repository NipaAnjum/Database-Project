$career = "Ahmed was the pioneer of printmaking in Bangladesh. He, along with Zainul Abedin and others, played an important role in the foundation of the Dhaka Art College (now the Faculty of Fine Arts of Dhaka University.[5]).

He was employed in Prahlad Karmarkar's studio. In one early painting there, he departed from pure narration to add his own perception and variation in the etching. Ramendranath chakravorty as a teacher of printmaking as a creative art form.inspired by them safiuddin learned the techniques of printmaking along with painting.even in the mid-twentieth century printmaking was not considered a mainstream medium in this subcontinent.even now in the government art college of kolkata at the bahelor's degree level printmaking is taught as a subject painting .the print making medium was not at that time among the mainstream media like painting and sculpture and one of safiuddin's greatest achievements is that he helped raise this discipline of apparently secondary importance by adopting it as the main medium for his creative works and assisted it to reach a status equal to that of painting and sculpture.while living in kolkata, the life of indigenous santals,give him inspiration to draw various picture.But after coming to east Pakistan the look, posture and the environment of his picture changed.Empty basket ,lemonade stand(pl.8.15)painted in oil colors in 1952 are quite perceptibly pictures of east bengal.The two painting :Fishing and carpenter done between 1954 and 1956 deserve special mention two reasons.In these two painting in oil colors we notice that he has tried to experiment with shapes more than in his landscape which are composed with the combination of light and shade.The color of these two paintings are strongly flat,the edges or contours of the forms subjective exaggeration has been resorted to rather than attempting to remain faithful to pictorially reconstruct the visual world in his own way.As a result,from this period his picture gradually start to move towards abstraction.In 1958 he completed the diploma course in printmaking from the central school of arts and crafts of London with distinction from 1956 to 1974.He visited different galleries of England ,France,Italy,Germany,Belgium,Netherlands,Switzerland,Soviet union and India.

Ahmed helped raise the profile of a printmaking, a discipline often considered of secondary importance, by adopting it as his main medium. He inspired many other artists from the subcontinent to begin printmaking.

Though Ahmed had been born and brought up in the city, he selected the landscape and life of the people in particularly remote areas of Radha Vangaand Jharkhand as the setting of his works. At the beginning of the `30s,Abanindranath painted the Arabian nights series.This series is the last one in his fine aesthetic romance style.In 1939 in the background of the second world war he took his brush in hand .his fine.soft style was transformed.He started to draw the pictures of the Krishnamangal series where painted the killing of seventeen asuras or demons by the child krishna.

In the oil paintings Sunlit Hut, Dumka-1, Dumka-2 and Dumka ShalForest done in 1946, he applied the pigment in strokes like the Impressionists; and did not create sfumato by mixing paints. ";
